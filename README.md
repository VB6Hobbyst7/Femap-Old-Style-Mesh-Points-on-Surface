# Femap-Old-Style-Mesh-Point-on-Surface
The Mesh Point Editor in Femap 12 is difficult to use. This macro recreates the Mesh Point on Surface command from Femap 11.

Two ways to use this:
1. Copy the code directly into the Femap API window and hit Play
2. Add the file to your User Tools Directory for convenient access via the drop-down menu
  (Note: Permanently set your User Tools Directory in the Femap Preferences window under the Library/Startup tab
