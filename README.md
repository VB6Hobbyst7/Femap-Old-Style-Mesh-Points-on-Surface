# Femap-Old-Style-Mesh-Points-on-Surface
The Mesh Point Editor in Femap 12 is difficult to use. This macro recreates the Mesh Point on Surface command from Femap 11.

This intuative and familiar method of creating mesh points allowes you to skip the new Mesh Point Editor completely. However, the resulting mesh points are fully compatible with the new Mesh Point Editor so you can switch between methods if desired.

If you're not familiar with using Femap scripts, see my writeup: [How to use Femap Scripts](https://github.com/aaronjasso/How_to_use_Femap_Scripts)
