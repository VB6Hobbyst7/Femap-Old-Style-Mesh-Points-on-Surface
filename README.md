The Mesh Point Editor in Femap 12 is difficult to use. This macro recreates the Mesh Point on Surface command from Femap 11.

Two ways to use this:
1. Copy the code from the .BAS file directly into the Femap API window and hit Play (maje sure it replaces any existing text)
2. Add the file to your User Tools Directory for convenient access via the drop-down menu
  (Note: Permanently set your User Tools Directory in the Femap Preferences window under the Library/Startup tab
