Two ways to use this:
1. Copy the code from the .BAS file directly into the Femap API window and hit Play (make sure it replaces any existing text)
2. Add the file to your User Tools Directory for convenient access via the drop-down menu
  (Note: Permanently set your User Tools Directory in the Femap Preferences window under the Library/Startup tab
